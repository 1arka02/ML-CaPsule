#The dataset  (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Bank Customer Churn Prediction dataset.
# There are three data sets one is training dataset,other one is test dataset and last one is submission for checking
# We intend to calculate the probability of each customer Exited from the bank 
The main features for the Training set are:
1.id
2.Surname
3.CustomerId
4.CreditScore	
5.Geography
6.Gender
7.Age
8.Tenure
9.Balance
10.NumOfProducts
11.HasCrCard
12.IsActiveMember
13.EstimatedSalary	
14.Exited


The objective for creating this is to provide enough resources for newbies in this field to have access to almost all the state of the art techniques to build great models for real word datasets, also ensuring fair play as the dataset for training and evaluation is synthetically generated and not publicly available, and very near to the feature distributions what we see in real world datasets.
